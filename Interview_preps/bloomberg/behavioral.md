# Why Bloomberg?
- I am interested in the diversity & Inclusion in the society and as a person who transitioned from the art field to computer science, it was such a shock to me that this field is not as diverse as I expected. 

I want to work for Bloomberg because it doesn't only see this is a problem but also shows its mission into an action; I heard Bloomberg is doing promoting a campaign and events for women in tech, trasnparently diversity and inclusion in hiring system. 

I also came across with this article that Bloomberg has this `BOB hours`(Best of Bloomberg Volunteer program) to extend the company's giving providing opportunities for its employees to contirbute to their local communities and donate its certain money on the non profit organizations every year. 
From these I feel Bloomberg is a company with actions. I see Bloomberg is trying to build this symbiotic relationship with its employees and other local communities to make our big community better. I think Bloomberg will be a company I would feel proud of working for.
